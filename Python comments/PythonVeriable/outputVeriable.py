# Output Variables
# The Python print() function is often used to output variables.
# Example

x = "Python is awesome"
print(x)


# In the print() function, you output multiple variables, separated by a comma:
# and You can also use the + operator to output multiple variables:
#Example

x = "Python"
y = "is"
z = "awesome"
print(x, y, z)

 # In the print() function, when you try to combine a string and a number with the + operator, Python will give you an error:
x = 5
y = "John"
print(x + y)

# The best way to output multiple variables in the print() function is to separate them with commas, which even support different data types:
x = 5 
y = "John"
print(x , y)
